# Football Analytics Dashboard

A local Streamlit dashboard built directly on top of the star-schema output of
`prj_fixed.ipynb` (`dim_player`, `dim_team`, `dim_league`, `dim_season`,
`fact_player_stats`).

## 1. Setup

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 2. Get the data in place

This app reads five CSVs from `./processed/`:

```
processed/dim_player.csv
processed/dim_team.csv
processed/dim_league.csv
processed/dim_season.csv
processed/fact_player_stats.csv
```

They are **exactly** the files produced by the last cell of `prj_fixed.ipynb`
(the "Export each table to its own file" step). This copy of `processed/`
already contains a real run of that notebook — to refresh the data (e.g.
after adding a new season), just re-run the notebook and overwrite this
folder with its `processed/` output.

## 3. Run it

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Opens at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Pages

- **Home** — league-wide overview: player/team counts, top scorers, top
  assisters, goals by team, with a raw-data export.
- **Player Season** — player profile, percentile-rank radar chart, key
  stats + extra stats (pass/shot accuracy, goals & assists per 90),
  **compare against any player from any league/season** (percentiles are
  computed against each player's own peer group so the comparison stays
  fair across competitions), a **season-by-season trend line**
  (Goals/Assists/xG/xA), and a full **season-by-season log table**.
- **Team Season** — squad summary, advanced team stats breakdown, top
  scorers, **compare against any team(s) from any league** (same season,
  cross-league), a **team trend line across seasons**, and the full
  squad table.
- **League Ranking** — bar-chart ranking of all players by a chosen metric
  (Attacking / Passing / Dribbling & Carrying / Defending / Creation),
  with min-minutes and position filters.
- **Quick Search** (sidebar, always visible) — type a player or team name
  and jump straight to their page with the right season/league preselected.
- **CSV / Excel export** — available on Home, Player Season, Team Season,
  and League Ranking wherever there's a data table.

## Note on cross-league comparisons

Comparisons (players and teams) are statistically valid, but keep in mind
the top-5 leagues differ in competitive level — a "Goals p90" comparison
between a Ligue 1 and a Premier League player is a fair stats comparison,
not necessarily a fair *quality* comparison.

## Known data limitation (carried over from the ETL notebook)

The 2025-2026 source file only has basic counting stats (Goals, Assists,
Minutes, Matches). It does **not** contain xG, xA, Shots, Progressive
actions, Tackles, Interceptions, Blocks, Touches, or Carries — those columns
are genuinely missing at the source, not a bug. The app detects this per
season/metric and shows a warning instead of an empty chart, the same way
the reference app in your screenshots showed
`"No player data available for this competition / season"`.

## Deploying to Azure later

Support for this is already built in — you don't need to change any page
code, just flip a switch. See **"Connecting to Azure Synapse"** below.

## Connecting to Azure Synapse

**⚠️ Security first:** never hardcode a server/database/username/password in
a `.py` file. Credentials go in `.streamlit/secrets.toml`, which is already
listed in `.gitignore` so it never gets committed or shared inside the zip.

### The real Synapse schema is already in place — already handled

The actual tables on Synapse (`dbo.Dim_Players`, `dbo.Dim_Teams`,
`dbo.Dim_Leagues`, `dbo.Dim_Seasons`, `dbo.Fact_PlayerStats`) use different
names/columns than the local `processed/*.csv` star schema (PascalCase,
`PlayerID`/`TeamID`/etc., plus a few extra columns like `Height_cm` that the
local pipeline doesn't produce, and missing a few the local pipeline *does*
have: `Key_Passes`, `Pass_Attempts`, `Pass_Completed`, `Touches`, `Carries`).

Every query in `db.py` explicitly qualifies each table with the `dbo.`
schema (e.g. `FROM dbo.Dim_Players`, not just `Dim_Players`) — matching
exactly what's shown in Synapse Studio's object explorer, so there's no
ambiguity about which schema is being read.

Instead of rewriting every page to know two different naming conventions,
**`db.py` translates at the SQL boundary** — every query aliases Synapse's
real column names into the same internal names the app already uses
(`player`, `team`, `Nation`, `Born`, `xg_diff`, ...). The 5 missing columns
are added back as empty (NaN) after loading, so those specific stats just
show as "unavailable" — exactly the same way the dashboard already handles
the 2025-2026 season's missing advanced stats. Nothing else in the app
needed to change.

### 1. Set up secrets

```bash
cp .streamlit/secrets.toml.example .streamlit/secrets.toml
```

Edit `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and fill in your real Synapse server,
database, username, and password.

### 2. Install the driver

```bash
pip install mssql-python
```

### 3. Tables already exist — nothing to create

If your Synapse tables already have the data (as they do now), skip
straight to step 5. `sql/create_tables.sql` is kept only as **reference
documentation** of the real schema, in case you ever need to rebuild the
database from scratch.

### 4. (Optional) Reload the data later

```bash
python sql/load_to_azure.py
```

Only needed if you refresh `processed/*.csv` (by re-running
`prj_fixed.ipynb`) and want to push the new data into the existing Synapse
tables. (For very large refreshes, `COPY INTO` from Blob Storage is faster
than row-by-row inserts — this script is meant to get you running quickly,
not to be the production loading pattern.)

### 5. Switch the dashboard to Azure

In `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:

```toml
data_source = "azure"
```

That's it — `data.py` detects this automatically and every page reads live
from Synapse instead of the local CSVs, with no other code changes. Set it
back to `"local"` any time to go back to the CSVs.
